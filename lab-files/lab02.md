def solve_dophentine_equation(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Solve the Dophentine equation of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0.

    Parameters:
    a (float): Coefficient of x^3.
    b (float): Coefficient of x^2.
    c (float): Coefficient of x.
    d (float): Constant term.

    Returns:
    list: A list of solutions to the equation.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the equation has no real solutions.

    Examples:
    >>> solve_dophentine_equation(1, -6, 11, -6)
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    >>> solve_dophentine_equation(1, -3, 3, -1)
    [1.0]
    >>> solve_dophentine_equation(1, 0, 0, 0)
    [0.0]
